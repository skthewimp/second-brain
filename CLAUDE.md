# Pensieve — Project Guide

Voice-driven personal wiki. Talk into your phone, a structured wiki builds itself.

### Phone pipeline
Record audio → WhisperKit transcribes on-device → Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-6) extracts title, themes, emotional tone, key quotes, connections → saves structured markdown to `raw/` in Obsidian vault.

### Mac wiki ingestion
`scripts/pensieve-ingest/` is a Swift Package. The `pensieve-ingest` binary (installed to `~/.local/bin/`) runs daily via a launchd user agent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.karthikshashidhar.pensieve.ingest.plist`. It finds unprocessed notes in `raw/` (by diffing against `wiki/log.md`), makes a single direct Claude API call with the wiki state + new notes, and applies the returned JSON patch to theme pages, timeline, contradictions, log, and index. `PensieveIngestCore` (the library target) is platform-agnostic so it can be imported into the iOS app for phone-only ingestion later.

Requires Full Disk Access granted to `/Users/Karthik/.local/bin/pensieve-ingest` so launchd-spawned runs can access the iCloud vault. API key is set via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the launchd plist's `EnvironmentVariables`.

### Obsidian vault location
`~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/SecondBrain/`

Syncs automatically between phone and Mac via iCloud.

## Key Technical Details

### Build & deploy
- Bundle ID: `com.karthikshashidhar.secondbrain`
- Team: `6APL9VM8C3`
- Build: `xcodegen generate` then `xcodebuild -project SecondBrain.xcodeproj -scheme SecondBrain`
- Phone device ID may change; use `xcrun xctrace list devices` to find current ID
- `xcodebuild install` wipes app data including cached WhisperKit model

### SwiftUI nested ObservableObject pattern
SwiftUI does NOT observe `@Published` properties on nested `ObservableObject`s. `ThoughtCaptureService` holds `audioRecorder` and `storageService` as plain properties. Their published state must be forwarded via Combine:

```swift
storageService.$isVaultLinked
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .assign(to: &$isVaultLinked)
```

This has been the single most common bug in this project. If adding new observable state to a child service, it MUST be forwarded through `ThoughtCaptureService`.

### WhisperKit model persistence
The model (~150MB) downloads from HuggingFace on first launch and caches in `Documents/huggingface/models/`. The code checks for cached `.mlmodelc` files before downloading. Only re-downloads if cache is empty (e.g., after app reinstall).

### Obsidian vault linking
Uses iOS security-scoped bookmarks to persist folder access. User picks vault via `UIDocumentPickerViewController`, app saves bookmark to `UserDefaults`. On launch, restores bookmark and re-accesses the folder.

## Current State (April 2026)

- App is functional, installed on user's phone
- Wiki ingestion rewritten as a Swift binary (`pensieve-ingest`) that does a single direct Claude API call — ~33x cheaper than the old agentic Claude Code path (~$0.01/note vs ~$0.36/note on a measured 10-note run)
- User is in "collect data for a week" mode — do NOT add features unless asked

### Known gotcha: Full Disk Access after macOS updates
`/Users/Karthik/.local/bin/pensieve-ingest` needs Full Disk Access so launchd-spawned runs can read the iCloud Obsidian vault. The binary is adhoc-signed, so macOS updates can invalidate the TCC grant while leaving the UI toggle visibly "on" — symptom is `error: The file "…md" couldn't be opened` in `/tmp/pensieve-ingest.log`. Fix: remove the entry with `–` in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access, re-add `/Users/Karthik/.local/bin/pensieve-ingest` (⌘⇧G to paste path), then test with `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.karthikshashidhar.pensieve.ingest`.

### Deferred work (user explicitly deferred these)
1. **Retrieval/resurfacing** — daily digests, "you're going in circles" alerts, related past notes on new capture. Waiting for usage data.
2. **Phone-only wiki ingestion** — currently needs Mac. Path is now clear: `PensieveIngestCore` is platform-agnostic and can be imported into the iOS app as a local SPM dependency via `project.yml`. The nontrivial part is swapping `FileManager` direct paths for the iOS security-scoped bookmark code that already exists in `ObsidianStorageService.swift`.
3. **Prompt caching optimization** — current runs show `cache_read/write: 0/0` because the system prompt is under the 1024-token cache minimum. Padding the system prompt with concrete examples (or caching the user-message block containing the wiki state) would cut cost by another ~30-50%. Not urgent at current cost level.
4. **Contradiction provenance tagging** — every entry in `contradictions.md` should be tagged as `EXTRACTED` (literal verbatim clash between two dated quotes), `INFERRED` (Claude's reading that two positions are in tension), or `AMBIGUOUS` (possibly contradictory, interpretation-dependent). Idea stolen from [safishamsi/graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify), which uses the same tagging for graph edges. Rationale: the contradictions page is the most valuable page in the wiki, and a hallucinated contradiction is much worse than a missed one — this tag lets the reader trust the mirror. Implementation is small: add a `kind: "extracted" | "inferred" | "ambiguous"` field to the contradictions schema in `IngestionPatch`, update the system prompt in `Prompts.swift` to require verbatim citations with source note IDs for `extracted` entries, and have the writer render the tag as a callout (`> [!extracted]` / `> [!inferred]` / `> [!ambiguous]`) at the top of each contradiction block. ~20 lines of Swift + a prompt tweak. Defer until after the data-collection week.
5. **Action item routing** — extract tasks from notes, push to external systems.
6. **Blog post revision** — first draft written, may revise after more usage.
7. **"Challenge" prompt at ingestion** — at ingestion time, actively surface past statements that conflict with the new note (not just passive contradiction logging after the fact). Inspired by [eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain)'s `/obsidian-challenge` tool. Implementation: add a step in `Prompts.swift` system prompt that asks Claude to check the new note against existing Evolution entries and flag live tensions. Sharper mirror than waiting for contradictions to accumulate passively.
8. **Periodic lint/health pass** — a `pensieve-ingest --lint` mode that scans the wiki for: orphan pages with no inbound links, concepts mentioned across multiple themes but lacking their own page, stale claims superseded by newer notes, missing cross-references. Outputs a health report. Inspired by both [garrytan/gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) (maintenance skills) and [eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain) (nightly reconciliation agent). Not needed until note volume hits ~50+.
9. **Entity pages** — dedicated pages for recurring people/companies (e.g., Barry, Manu, Pinkie) that accumulate a compiled summary + reverse-chron timeline of every mention. Currently people are folded into theme pages which works at low volume but won't scale. Inspired by [garrytan/gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain)'s `people/` directory with per-entity dossiers.
10. **Bi-temporal fact tracking** — record both *when something was true* and *when the vault learned it*. Adds an audit trail of belief evolution. Pairs with contradiction provenance (item 4). Inspired by [eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain](https://github.com/eugeniughelbur/obsidian-second-brain).
